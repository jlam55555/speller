#### Description
One of the more practical applications I've created. It is given a list of 450 predefined spelling words (in `words.txt`) that it randomly iterates through. It sounds out the word (using the JavaScript [Speech Synthesis API](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/getting-started-speech-synthesis-api)).

Also an "extras" project under my blog, [TheHomeworkLife](http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf) ([GitHub](https://github.com/jlam55555/the-homework-life)).

#### Features
- Modern, clean interface
- Large set of default words
- Speech uses the new-ish JavaScript Speech Synthesis API
- Print view shows completed words and number of times wrong per word
- Regular view shows completed words and number of times wrong per word (with degree of redness)
- Clicking on a word will bring you to a definition on Wiktionary
- "Hide" feature can give more realistic, difficult experience
- Correct spelling will be provided after six incorrect tries
